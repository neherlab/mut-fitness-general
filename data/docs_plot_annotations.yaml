  #   section: expected
  #   legend: |
  #     Interactive plot of neutral mutation rates for each SARS-CoV-2 clade estimated using 
  #     four-fold degenerate synonymous sites. 

  #     The plot at left shows the fraction of all mutations at four-fold degenerate sites
  #     that are of each type, and the plot at right shows the relative rates of these
  #     mutations obtained after normalized for nucleotide composition.

  #     You can mouseover points for details, click/shift-click on the bar at bottom to select
  #     specific mutation types, and click/shift-click on the legend at right to select
  #     specific clades.

  #   section: expected
  #   legend: |
  #     Interactive plot of average counts per nucleotide site averaged over all clades and
  #     sites. Counts are reported separately for the expected counts (estimated from
  #     4-fold degenerate sites) and the counts for all synonymous mutations (including 4-fold
  #     degenerate sites), nonsynonymous mutations, and stop mutations. Counts are stratified
  #     by the type of nucleotide change in the mutation.

  #     specific types of counts.

  # effects_histogram:
  #   title: distribution of fitness effects of mutations
  #   section: distribution
  #   legend: |
  #     Interactive histograms of the estimated fitness effects of different types of mutations.
  #     Mutations are stratified by whether they are nonsynonymous, synonymous, or introduce
  #     a stop codon. Mutations with negative fitness effects are deleterious.

  #     The *minimum expected count* slider below the plot indicates how many expected counts
  #     of a mutation we require before making a fitness estimate. Larger values yield more
  #     accurate estimates but for fewer mutations. Move the slider to the left to show
  #     estimates for more mutations at lower confidence, and move it to the right to show

  #     rectangles span the interquartile range. Mutations with negative fitness
  #     effects are deleterious.

  #     Note that ORF9b is encoded by an alternative overlapping reading frame  with N,
  #     which complicates interpretation of selection on mutations in this gene.

    title: correlation of fitness estimates for different clusters of viral clades
    section: correlation
    legend: |
      Interactive plot of the correlation between fitness estimates made using different

      The *minimum predicted count* slider below the plot indicates how many expected counts of an
      an amino acid we require before making a fitness estimate. Larger values yield more
      accurate estimates but for fewer amino acids. So move the slider to the left to show
      estimates for more amino acids at lower confidence, and move it to the right to show
      estimates for fewer amino acids at higher confidence.

    section: correlation
    legend: |
      Interactive plot of the correlation between novel and naive fitness estimates made using different
      subsets of the sequence data. Each point represents a fitness estimate for a
      different amino-acid mutation. The Pearson correlation coefficient and the number
      of mutations being correlated are shown in the upper left of the scatter plot.

      You can mouse over points for details.

      The scatter can be filtered according to two thresholds: minimum *predicted counts* and minimum *expected counts*.
      The former are used to compute novel probabilistic fitness estimates, while the latter are used to compute naive fitness estimates.
      For both thresholds, larger values yield more accurate estimates but for fewer amino acids. So move the slider to the left to show
      estimates for more amino acids at lower confidence, and move it to the right to show estimates for fewer amino acids at higher confidence.

  #     Click *yes* for the *only show mutations measured in all subsets* box to only show
  #     the same subset of mutations in each panel; otherwise different panels may show
  #     different subsets of mutations depending on which mutations have measurements or
  #     fitness estimates for each pair of variables being correlated.

  #     For the RBD deep mutational scanning, the effects of mutations are averaged across

  # heatmaps of mutational effects
  pol: &heatmap_template
    section: heatmap
    legend: |
      Interactive plot of fitnesses amino acids at each site estimated from the observed versus
      predicted counts of the amino acids among natural sequences.

      The black area plot at top shows the mean fitness for all non-stop amino acids at each
      site, with more negative values
      indicating mutations at a site tend to be deleterious. The plot is zoomable, and you can
      click and drag with the mouse to highlight specific regions to show in the heat map. You
      can use the *site fitness statistic* click box at bottom to change whether the black area
      plot at top shows the mean, maximum, or minimum fitness of amino acids at that site.
      You can use the *show stop* option at bottom to overlay the effect of stop codon mutations
      on this plot.

      The heat map shows the estimated fitness values for specific amino acids. Red indicates
      low fitness (deleterious) amino acids, and blue indicates high fitness amino acids.
      Gray indicates amino acids with insufficient natural evolutionary data to make estimates
      (typically only single-nucleotide accessible amino acids will be shown). You can
      mouse over points in the heat map for details, and zoom using the area plot at top.
      The **x** at each site indicates the wildtype amino acid in the *oldest* clade of a cluster,
      indicated by the dropdown box below the plot. The button below allows to visualize amino acids
      mutational effects for a specific cluster of clades.

      The *minimum expected count* slider below the plot indicates how many predicted counts of an
      an amino acid we require before making a fitness estimate. Larger values yield more
      accurate estimates but for fewer amino acids. So move the slider to the left to show
      estimates for more amino acids at lower confidence, and move it to the right to show
      estimates for fewer amino acids at higher confidence.
    title: Pol amino-acid fitnesses
  # fitness_vs_terminal:
  #   title: fitness effects versus number of descendant sequences
  #   section: terminal
  #   legend: |
  #     Interactive plot of the correlation between fitness estimates of mutations and number
  #     of descendants. This plot is designed to help assess whether mutations with higher
  #     fitness tend to be associated with more descendant sequences.
      
  #     Two measures are provided for number of descendants. The first is the log ratio
  #     of branches with the mutation that are internal on the tree (non-terminal)
  #     versus to (to tip nodes). The second is the log number of tip-node descendants
  #     sharing all mutations on a branch. In both cases, larger values indicate a mutation
  #     tends to have more descendants.

  #     Each point on the plot represents a fitness estimate for a
  #     different amino-acid mutation. The Pearson correlation coefficient and the number
  #     of mutations being correlated are shown in the upper left of the scatter plot.
  #     The mutations are stratified by whether they are nonsynonymous, synonymous, or
  #     introduce a stop codon.

  #     You can mouse over points for details.

  #     The *minimum actual count* slider below the plot indicates the total number of
  #     observed counts we require for a mutation before it is shown on the plot. The
  #     non-terminal to terminal ratio may be noisier for smaller values of this threshold,
  #     although more deleterious mutations are also expected to have lower actual counts.
    
  #     The *minimum expected count* slider below the plot indicates how many expected counts of an
  #     an amino acid we require before making a fitness estimate. Larger values yield more
  #     accurate estimates but for fewer amino acids. So move the slider to the left to show
  #     estimates for more amino acids at lower confidence, and move it to the right to show
  #     estimates for fewer amino acids at higher confidence.

  #     You can click/shift-click on specific genes in the legend below the plot to only
  #     show mutations for that gene.

  #     The log ratio of the non-terminal to terminal counts is computed after adding a
  #     pseudocount of 0.5 to each count.

  # clade_fixed_muts:
  #   title: fitness effects of mutations fixed in at least one clade
  #   section: fixed
  #   legend: |
  #     Interactive plot of the fitness effects of amino-acid mutations fixed in at least one clade,
  #     stratified by non-spike and spike mutations. The point shapes show the overall fitness
  #     estimate using data from all clades, the estimates from just forward mutation counts
  #     in clades without the mutation, and the estimates (when available) for direct amino-acid
  #     reversions in clades with the mutation fixed. Note that we exclude direct nucleotide
  #     reversions in counts because they are error-prone due to calling to consensus, and so
  #     reversion estimates are often unavailable. Missing points indicate no estimate can be
  #     made for a mutation from the available data.

  #     Mouseover points for details.

  #     The *minimum expected count* slider below the plot indicates how many expected counts of an
  #     an amino acid we require before making a fitness estimate. Larger values yield more

  # clade_fixed_muts_hist:
  #   title: fitness effects of mutations fixed in a clade versus all mutations
  #   section: fixed
  #   legend: |
  #     The histograms show the effects of all mutations (to the reference genome)
  #     with fitness estimates, and just those mutations that have fixed in a clade.

  #     The *minimum expected count* slider below the plot indicates how many expected counts of an
  #     an amino acid we require before making a fitness estimate. Larger values yield more
  #     accurate estimates but for fewer amino acids. So move the slider to the left to show
  #     estimates for more amino acids at lower confidence, and move it to the right to show

  # dnds_corr:
  #   title: correlation of dN/dS with site-average fitness estimates and DMS data
  #   section: comparisons
  #   legend: |
  #     The top plot shows the correlation between log dN/dS estimates and the site-average mean
  #     estimated fitness effects of amino-acid mutations for each gene.

  #     The bottom plot shows how well the site-average mutational effect measured in deep
  #     mutational scanning (DMS) experiments correlates with the site-average mean
  #     estimated fitness effects of mutations, or the log dN/dS values.

  #     The plots are interactive and you can mouse over points for detail.

  #     The dN/dS values are taken from [here](https://github.com/spond/SARS-CoV-2-variation).

  # comparator_corr:
  #   title: correlation of mutation effect estimates from other studies with fitness estimates and spike DMS data
  #   section: comparisons
  #   legend: |
  #     This plot correlates the mutation effects estimated in three other studies with the fitness
  #     effects estimated in the current study and full-spike deep mutational scanning from
  #     [Dadonaite et al (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.02.001).

  #     The mutation effects being used in the comparisons are from the following studies:

  #       - [Maher et al (2022)](https://www.science.org/doi/suppl/10.1126/scitranslmed.abk3445)
  #       - [Rodriguez-Rivas et al (2022)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2113118119)
  #       - [Thadani et al (2023)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.21.501023v2)

  #     For Rodriguez-Rivas et al, only site estimates are provided so the correlation is with
  #     the site-mean estimated fitness and measured DMS values. For the other studies,
  #     the correlation is with the mutation effects. Each row only shows points for mutations/sites
  #     measured by all three methods.
